# qtdemo_budget_tracker
A short and sweet Qt budget tracker project to keep my Qt skills up to date.


# Goals

The goal is very simple: to keep my Qt skills up-to-date and provide a short demo of my Qt knowledge to whoever needs to see it.

# TODOs

These are the things still left to do in the demo:

1. [DONE] Add Expense: A simple form where users can input an expense amount, category (from a predefined list), and a note.
2. [DONE] View Expenses: A list or table displaying added expenses.
3. [IN PROGRESS] Basic Data Persistence: Save and load expenses using SQLite.
4. Category Filtering: Implement a feature to filter the listed expenses by category.
5. ? Basic Analytics: Add a simple summary (e.g., total expenses) at the bottom of the view expenses list.
6. ? UI Enhancements: Introduce minor improvements for a better user experience, such as date pickers for expense entries.

The features that are marked with ? are optional. They will only be added if the main app does not reach ~1K lines with the first 3 features.


# Licensing
